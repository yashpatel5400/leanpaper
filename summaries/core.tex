[\textbf{Conformal Contextual Robust Optimization}](contextual_robust_optimization/core.tex) demonstrates how informative, non-convex uncertainty quantification produced by conformal prediction can be efficiently used for robust decision-making. 

[\textbf{Conformal Prediction for Ensembles}]((conformal_prediction_for_ensembles/core.tex)) extends conformal prediction to ensemble or multi-view models by introducing the notion of a "vector score" function and acceptance quantile envelope.
